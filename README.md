# SubSpace-Task-

Hello, Guys this will be my take on the given specific task for Subspace Internship I hope you like it 

In this code:

1 - I have defined a function fetchBlogData that makes the HTTP request to the third-party blog API and returns the fetched data. This function is used in both the /api/blog-stats and /api/blog-search routes.

2 - The /api/blog-stats route retrieves blog data using fetchBlogData, performs the specified analytics using Lodash, and responds with the statistics in JSON format.

3 - The /api/blog-search route accepts a query parameter and filters blogs based on the provided query string (case-insensitive) using the filter method.

4 - Error handling is implemented in both routes, logging any errors and responding with appropriate error messages.

Thank You for giving this opportunity... :)
